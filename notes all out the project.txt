checkmypass:
	1.PASSWORD API(url)::to given url we pass over password, throught this we find that how many users was check over password or try to hack it
	now what we gonna do,, we just convert over password in 'md5'  hash algo rithm by google website"https://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php".
	it give us converted md5 versioned password throught out this we not gonna give actuall charcter password to some random website by checking it(random websute like given in url)

	2.CREATE FUNCTION LIKE"DEF REQUESTES_API_DATA(QUERY_CHAR) & DEF PWEND_API_CHECK(PASSWORD)::in this we gonna put over url and respornse code by checking the actuall password in function,'request_api_check' indicate the api who gonna rquest to check and'query_char'indicate the dynamic password checker string.
	and 'pwend_api-check'convert passwordinto sha1 hash function.

	3.IMPORT HASHLIB:a hashlib library do to cob=nvert our given password into sha1 .we used in it to second function 'pwend_apicheck(password)'.in it we saw
	'hashdigest'which convert our code into doblue length of converted oassword length in hexadecimal format.

	4.DEF READ-RES(RESPONSE):this function give each and every response text indiviually by"response.text".

	5.DEF GET_PASSWORD_LEACKS_COUNT(HASHES,HASH_TO_CHECK):in this function we gonna check the leak password count by seprating them in ":"manner.by using splitlines in given tuple.(note:hashes is passed in tuple.)
